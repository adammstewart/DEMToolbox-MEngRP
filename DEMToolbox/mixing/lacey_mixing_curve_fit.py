    ### Curve for the Lacey mixing model.

    The Lacey mixing model is a exponential model that describes the 
    mixing of a binary system. The model is classically defined as [1] 
    [2]:

    .. math:: 
    
        M(t) = 1 - (1 - M_0) e^{-kt}

    where :math:`M(t)` is the Lacey mixing index at time :math:`t`, 
    :math:`M_0` is the initial Lacey Mixing index, :math:`k` is the 
    mixing rate constant, and :math:`t` is the time.

    An extension of the Lacey mixing model to include a time constant
    :math:`\\tau` to allow for delayed onset of exponential mixing 
    mixing behavior was proposed by Ratnayake et al. [2]:

    .. math::

        M(t) = max(1 - (1 - M_0) e^{-k(t - \\tau)})

    This mixing model is used to fit the mixing data as with no delayed
    onset of exponential mixing Ratnayake et al.'s model reduces to the
    classical Lacey mixing model.

    ## MEng-RP additions

    In my MEng-RP a singular value of resolution was used to sample multiple fill heights, as such  the bin volumes vary across runs. This may mean that :math:`M_0 != 0` and varies across runs, and also may mean that :math:`M_{final} != 1`. The above proposed model already uses :math:`M_0` as a parameter, and as such no changes are made in that respect. However, the final value of the Lacey mixing index is taken to be 1 in these models. For the purpose of time-series analysis in my MEng-RP, the term :math:`M_{plateau}` is used to represent the value of Lacey mixing index when the system cannot become more mixed, where :math:`0<M_{plateau}<=1.` As such the Lacey mixing model is expressed as:

    .. math::
    
        M(t) = M_{plateau} - (M_{plateau} - M_0) e^{-kt}.

    Due to the nature of sampling, :math:`M` continues to vary slightly, even after a "stable" degree of mixing has been reached. For the purpose of my MEng-RP, whether a mixture had reached :math:`M_{plateau}` is determined as the point at which the variance of 10 consecutive values of :math:`M` falls below a threshold value, 0.01, and the value of :math:`M_{plateau}` is taken to be the mean of those 10 values.

    k : float

For the purpose of time-series analysis in my MEng-RP, the term :math:`M_{plateau}` is used to represent the value of Lacey mixing index when the system cannot become more mixed, where :math:`0<M_{plateau}<=1.` As such the Lacey mixing model and the extended model are expressed as:

    .. math::
    
        M(t) = M_{plateau} - (M_{plateau} - M_0) e^{-kt},

    and
    .. math::
        M(t) = max(M_{plateau} - (M_{plateau} - M_0) e^{-k(t - \\tau)})

    respectively.

    Due to the nature of sampling, :math:`M` continues to vary slightly, even after a "stable" degree of mixing has been reached. For the purpose of my MEng-RP, whether a mixture had reached :math:`M_{plateau}` is determined as the point at which the variance of `window_size` consecutive values of :math:`M` falls below a threshold value, `var_threshold`, and the value of :math:`M_{plateau}` is taken to be the mean of those `window_size` values.

    Parameters

    time : array-like
        The time data for the lacey mixing index.
    m : array-like
        The lacey mixing index data.
    window_size : int, optional
        The number of consecutive values to consider when determining if the system has reached the plateau value of the Lacey mixing index, by default 10.
    var_threshold : float, optional
        The variance threshold to determine if the system has reached the plateau value of the Lacey mixing index, by default 0.01.
    t0 : int or float
        The time at which mixing begins by default 0.
    tend : int or float, optional
        The time at which mixing ends, by default None. If None, then
        all the time data from the start time will be used.

    Returns
    -------
    popt : array-like
        The optimal values for the parameters k and tau.

        The time data for the mixing period used in the fit.

        fit.

        calculated using the optimal parameters.
